The data named "Days" is mapped to the x axis and is a discrete variable in this case.
The data named "% PAH Remaining" is mapped to the y axis (different colours represent different PAHs) and is a continuous variable.
The data are displayed using both points (with error bars) and lines. 

## Unsuccesful plot

This is a pie chart so there's no x variable.
The y variable is the number of samples that tested positive for animal coronaviruses in livestock (also represented by a colour variation based on coronavirus type). It is a discrete variable

* I think this plot is unsuccessful because the colour scheme used doesn't have a distinct variation so it's difficult to differentiate between the different shades of blue. Though the figures along the curve are more useful in identifying what coronavirus was present than the colour scheme, the large number of categories makes the pie chart look clustered. 
* I think this data could have been better represented using a table or a bar graph if you wanted some more visual stimulation.
